I think some of the most important things I get from this article is that when doing designing, it’s better tone prepared. I have a habit to think everything in my mind while doing projects. But many time the process or the outcome of the product didn’t appear as I predicted. Wireframe is the part I’m missing. It’s a middle part between thinking and producing, which I often skip but very important. Especially in UX designs, wireframe help you to keep to your aim of the product, like your focus question and your audience during the later processes. It provides a sketch pad that failures won’t cause bigger losses compared in actual producing. And it helps to keep a clear track and a bigger picture when working on a bigger and more complex projects. I’d say that I personally had a clearer mind doing this week’s homework after making a wireframe for myself, which I seldom do before.
