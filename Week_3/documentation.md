I added some css styling to the webpage I made with html from last week. For structuralizing the webpage, I separated different blocks by the categories of header, asides, articles and footer. Styles are added according to different blocks including width, height, background color, margin, padding. The aside bars are floated to the left while the articles are floated to the right. One problem I’m having is that the second side bar couldn’t align with the article I want it to. Another problem is that although I set the wrapper div, it only show at the header part, but not around the rest of the articles.
