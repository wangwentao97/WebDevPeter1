For this week’s assignment, I decided to make a slide sow using JavaScript. I used bootstrap’s button style to practice using bootstrap. I decided to practice more on using jQuery syntax so I used jQuery to write the code. 
The process was straight forward. The basic content of the page would be an image area with three buttons to control which image to show up. Then in the script part, I followed the process we did in class, including adding event listener, giving functions to the button. The problem I met was that at first I wasn’t familiar with the jQuery syntax, and thought that changing the image was to use “.src()”. Obviously it didn’t work, I then googled and figured the correct way to change the image source is “.attr()”.
