For this weekâ€™s assignment, I generally followed the guide presented. I first finished creating new folders, adding contents, adding and uploading my first file to my own GitHub repository, strictly following the guide, named as Hello World.
Then for the homework assignment, I first googled one of my favorite cooking recipe, the Korean style fried chicken. Then I copied the recipe and created a new read me file using sublime text. Then I saved the file in the Week_1 folder in my GitHub folder WebDevPeter1. Then I used terminal to add and upload my new updates to my GitHub repository.
